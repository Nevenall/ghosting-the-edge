# Development Log for `Write`

## 10.21.2020, danb

Currently this is very much designed to be forked for a project, but if we provide the ability to specify a file or a glob to gulp then we could use this as something like an ehanced writing environment. 

Ie, I want to be able to open a markdown file from whereevers and run the various tasks against it from within the editor. Should be pretty easy to do. 
 
- [✓] add an arg to the gulp tasks to allow specifying the file to check. Might not apply to all tasks, but at least spelling and prose. 
- [✓] change the vs code tasks to allow for running them on the current editor.

had to roll back to v12 node to keep the spellchecker working.  rawr! got the action working for individual files though.
We have a prose lint, but I think I'd like to have a task specificly for markdown linting. 

- add a gulp and vs task for linting the markdown

When we compile our book, create the book.json with everything but explicit content. We can do relative pathing, I think. 
Also do complete table of contents with pages and sections of pages. 
I wonder if we can use a toc markdown module to gather that data?
