# Editing Notes

These are editing notes
* not going to include a generic aspect for each item. 
* no generic gear, everything gets a special brand name
* revisit illegal/hard to aquire tasks

Magma Carta Personal Explosives™

lol!


if we compact the stunts for gear, i think it's easy to see where the cost diff is, but it we spell it out

alternately, we could got for a baseline with expansion options style. 

# Gear [1¤]

words.

:aspect[aspect], :aspect[aspect]

Skill 2

**Stunt 1**​—Description

**Stunt 2 [+1¤}**​—Description


Part of the issue is that this description issue is an issue with generic items. 
if it's a very specific named item, then this is less of an issue. and in such cases the above base, plus options might be clearer


## Color and cyberpunk stuff

Which is better? to extract the interesting color bits into sidebars? that makes them skippable, or you can read them all and skip the main text. Could make them a little easier to find. 
Or, we integrate them into the text, which may make the main text more interesting, but maybe more bloated? 
If it's a website, then it's probably? better to pull them out and keep the page from being a block of text. Give distractions and additions. 

Sidebars and quotes are for non-game stuff. Callouts are for game stuff, but can include stat descriptions of things like the dis and it's aspects and such. 

this seems be a pretty good approach. 

todo - color and flavor text should be moved to sidebars.
todo - examples should probabbly be moved to callouts.
todo - move interesting settings likes, like the Dis further up in the text. 
todo - for that matter consider rearranging the text for web. 
todo - Title case aspect text
todo - Do we need some bookshelf markup for images? align right/left, wrap and such? 
todo—consider revised layout

1. chapter 1 - The Usual Suspects
  1) an simple intro to stuff
  2) basic basic concepts like Currency and the Dis

2. chapter last - essays about cyberpunk. If fucking want them.  



todo—what if we changed up em-dashes with something programmy, like >>> or => like a modern index pointing finger. 
todo - make a rendered page that shows the various markup stuff we want. Examples of all the stuff
todo - make sure that all aspects are title cased, manually
