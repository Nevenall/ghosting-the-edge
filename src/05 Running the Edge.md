# Running the Edge

## Hacking Your Game

### More Bigger

If you want to take your game to a higher level of enhancement, you can expand the list of free upgrades that are available to the characters. Perhaps they are corporate employees who can get a range of sponsored tech that doesn't cost stunt slots but does come with strings attached. Or you can give characters an extra budget of slots to use only for upgrades. This works well if they're veteran characters who've seem some personal successes.

You can modify the initial gear budget as well.

Make it 3×Resources, or give the players a sponsor budget to use for their corp resources.

Or, for characters down on their luck, maybe they only have 1×Resources, or less as a gear budget.

<!-- sponsorship is clearly the most interesting one here -->

## Background

This section contains setting details that are assumed to be true. It's not at all necessary for you to know them or use them, but players and GMs can take them as common knowledge for educated characters. Nothing here is secret, but there's no guarantee that these details are all true, or are the whole story, they are only assumed to be true. 

<!-- :aspect[I'm going to move this after character stuff. Because it's background stuff. So, the game creation stuff can stay though because game creation and character creation go very much hand in hand.] -->

### Tech

:::sidebar{.left}
Way back everyone was scared cloning would confuse the value of human life but, it was the neuroscientists they really should have been worried about.
:::

#### Your Mind Laid Bare

We now understand enough about how the brain processes sensory information, stores memories, and makes decisions that we can electronically simulate and interact with those systems.

This one advancement spawned three main branches of tech: artificial intelligence, interface implants, and cybernetic prosthetics all the way up to completely artificial brains.

#### You are Interfaced

 <!-- "Interface technology has radically altered the way we interact with machines and each other." Alternately to that. "Interface technology lets us hack nets with our minds, share our thoughts, simulate entire worlds right down to physical sensation, and infect someone's brain with a computer virus."  -->

<!-- I've established the value prop for interface tech so now we do a quick run down of what you can do with it, what it makes possible. Maybe imply ways that it affects society. -->

We can sniff your sensory centers and record everything you experience. And we can feed external data into your brain so you can plug a machine right into your brain and it will talk to you so only you can hear and show you things only you can see. You can project your consciousness into a machine, or the Net, or a fantasy world. You can control machines with your mind, and even share your thoughts and memories with other people.

Crafted sensory information can be fed directly into your brain too. Complete 3d visions and soundscapes of course, but more than that: touches, smells, and flavors more intense and subtle then anything you could ever experience in the real world.

These days we even have a good enough handle on your decision making that your latest generation interface enabled handgun will pipe your brain cues about which of the targets you are tracking are hostiles and which are not.

You can think of a device you've never seen before or recall a few images from a movie and search the Net for them. Think of a face you know and call them with a thought.

We can even network our brains together and share our thoughts and memories. Or if you are less for togetherness, hack their mind and place false memories in their head.

##### The Implant

The modern interface implant is a vast network of nano-wires connected to the sensory, memory, and decision making centers of your brain. They all converge at a socket usually implanted at the back of your neck, behind your ear, or on your temple.

That's the implant part; the interface itself is a small computer that locks into your socket and knows how to translate between brain-speak and machine-speak.

Socket implants let you swap out one interface for another without needing to redo all your expensive brain wiring every time. That's the idea anyway, but interfaces are made by Corps and Corps will lock you into coming back to them anytime they can, so most interfaces are only compatible with sockets from the same Corp. There's always third-party adapters, but you've heard all kinds of horror stories about those. After all, an interface is a thing that can literally mess with your mind.

 <!-- :aspect[proposed blockquote]:aspect[pay off that statement. What are the stories? Callout?] -->

There will still be times when you need to have wiring work done because neuron growth moves the wires around or the next generation of implant tech has hit the market and the new features require new wiring.

##### The Interface

The interface itself is a small computer that seats into your implant socket. Most models are about 5cm high, 5cm wide, and 2cm thick; but many are even smaller. They don't need external controls because A properly working interface device will project it's UI into directly into your brain.

Models from previous generations of interface tech do have indicator lights for error states because they were designed for implants that were bare sockets and lacked the onboard intelligence to tell you the state of your interface/implant connection.

###### Connecting

Interfaces have at least one physical socket for connecting to smart devices via a wire. Samurai prefer interfacing with their smartgun using a physical wire over using a wireless connection for obvious anti-hacking and jamming reasons.

However, the much preferred way to interface with your smartgun is through a contact plate. That's a bit of bare metal implanted in your palm or fingertip which is physically connected to your interface but through a wire that's internal to your body so it's as vulnerable to being cut or grabbed. Contact plates latch magnetically on to a contact on your smart device and you are off to the races my friend.

Every interface has a wireless radio, though they vary in range, signal quality, and connection stability quite a bit. The wireless radio lets you connect to nets, smartdevices, and even the Net without any physical contact. Your interface can also use it to connect to the Net on your behalf. This is how the smarter interface models with build-in personal assistants are able to, say, independently do some research for you and report back the results.

This is also what allows you to communicate with people, directly or indirectly.

###### Sensors

They also have GPS built in, sensors that respond to the amount of light your eyes are receiving.

And all many of biofeedback sensors that track your physical functions. These are especially important for cyborgs learning to operate their bodies.

###### Silent Mode

You can go dark by disabling your wireless radio, GPS, and other sensors to prevent people from tracking your signal or hacking into your brain. Of course, if something happens to you then your friends will only know where you went dark, not where your body might be now. That's assuming you have friends…

###### Identity and Security

Every interface is imprinted with a unique identifier and personal data it will present to any system you interface with. You never need keys because your apartment, your office, your car, and any other system can be told to recognize (and record) your unique interface signal and open for your automatically, or report your attempt to enter an unauthorized area.

Interface ids can be spoofed to fool systems into thinking you are someone else. There's a thriving black market for unlocked interfaces that allow you to present a fake or stolen identity. Getting your first unlocked interface is like getting your hacker diploma.

<!-- :aspect[should make that sentence, or something like it, a block quote. ] -->

Secure physical locations add security to your interface identity by requiring you to present a biometric like a fingerprint or retinal scan.

Online security may require you also know a password, or pass-image, or even pass-thought in addition to your interface id.

Corps would love to be able to do a quick scan of the brain attached to an interface and check it against some kind of pattern they have stored; a mind fingerprint if you will, to make spoofing that much harder, but no one has perfected such technology yet.

##### Older Interface Technologies

It wasn't always wires planted directly into your brain. Before we had the nanotechnology to connect wires to neurons we used 'trode headsets. They are ok at reading your thoughts, but they are really bad at input. They can handle simple augmented reality projections, but the Net experience you get is less immersive then it is vague and tingly.

#### Smart Devices

Smart devices are interface enabled machines with the capability to allow you to control them with your brain and to provide you information back. Some devices have a more immersive experience than others, and your degree of control over them is limited to what they've been programmed to control and the extent to which you can hack through some of the safety features to allow you to control things the manufacturer didn't want you to.

Any standard smart-car can project a virtual instrument panel into your vision and give you all the information you want. Cars equipped with autopilots can also allow you to control them with your mind because the steering and acceleration is under computer control. The pinnacle, of course, is the car especially rigged for total interface. Every sensor reports to your brain as it was part of your own body. Low fuel like a gnawing hunger in your gut, the pure adrenaline thrill of acceleration.

#### Augmented Reality

Anything you can imagine can be overlain into your field of vision through an interface. It might be a targeting information from your smartgun, a reminder about a meeting, an audio notice of an incoming call, or the control panel of the smart vehicle you are piloting. If you go to a restaurant, the menu pops up in your vision when you step through the door.

Augmented reality is by far the most common manner of interacting with devices, nets, and even the Net. Total immersion interfacing is more of a special occasion reserved for visiting interesting constructs or for dramatic narratives in senima.

<!-- :aspect[more then just vision? What about information from other kinds of neural devices…What's it like to use AR to move through nets and interact with the Net? What does it feel and look like. ] -->

#### nets

Short for networks; nets with a little 'n' exist anywhere two devices share information. Your interface and smartgun are technically a net. It's a flexible term because nets can be layered and connected in a myriad of ways. Connect them together into a supernet, or connected to everything through the Net. A net is commonly divided into at least two subnets, one public and one private accessible only to a select group of known interface ids. Big corps nets have many many more layers of subnet with ever increasing exclusion and security.

Take that big black corp headquarters building down in the core for example. It's got a densely layered system of nets. There's the public net for visitors with every interface and smartdevice in range connected to it. Usually with some cheesy AR persona welcoming you and offering to "guide you through your first visit to our…" blah blah blah… Then there's the private net for employees with all their interfaces and smartdevices, plus employee workstations and business machines connected to the big servers that run the operations and store data. Layer on to that, all the systems that operate the building's physical features: doors, security, fire prevention, and climate control. And on top of that, connect this building to the corp's larger global net which reaches into every other corp facility and employee there is.

<!-- :aspect[we can expand on this from the hacking section too. Anything else that we'd like to know? What they look like through an interface. Focus on how net interface is built from AR] -->

#### Sensorium

Sensorium is the entirety of your sense input. Every bit of sensory data that reaches your brain, conscious or not, that is your sensorium and we can record it, we can store it, we can search it, and we can even hack it and play it back to you, or to your boss.

Edited sensorium recordings, and completely synthetic ones, called senima or sen-cin are produced for public entertainment. Purists make noise about the superior depth and subtly of unedited sensorium.

<!-- :aspect[there are extra sections that we can talk about here. Thoughts and memories. Transference/transmission of memories. Or do we leave that for the cybernetic body section.] -->

:::sidebar{.left}
##### Thoughts and Memories

Do sensorium recordings include thoughts and even recalled memories? And if they do are they routinely edited out for commercial products, and what if someone didn't? This is a question for you to answer for your own game.
:::

#### Constructs (AKA: Virtual Realities)

Interface with nets is mostly a visual experience. Senima gives you all the senses, but it's pre-recorded. A construct is a complete programmatic environment you can interface with. The sensations of your physical body and environment are suppressed so it feels like you are really part of the constructed environment.

##### Closing up the Gaps

You might wonder how much bandwidth is required to send a completely detailed virtual environment into your brain but, it's less than you'd expect. The brain is a machine that's perfected its ability to take confusing and incomplete sensory input, filter it, fill in the gaps, and knit it all together to a sensorium that seems complete and consistent to you. A lot of the power of VR is based on exploiting the brain's ability to interpolate. You can create a VR with missing bits and details and let the brains of the users fill them in.

##### Virutal Horizons​​—What Can You do in A Construct

The default is that you can do whatever want, but construct programmers will often restrict or use negative feedback to prevent some behaviors. Many public constructs are continuously monitored and policing is as easy as running a program.

#### Everything is Interfaced​​—The Global Network 

There is the vast web upon web of nets with a little n but then there is The Net with a capital N. Really, The Net is a diverse set of infrastructure which weaves nearly every little net in the world into a single global tapestry of connections.

##### Persistently Connected

The Net makes your personalized data and services accessible to you whenever and wherever you want them through a wireless interface. You can check the internal temperature of your apartment while skiing the slopes of a private enclave.

A The Net is more than a virtual shadow of the real world, it's more like billions of worlds all interconnected in a web as vast as the night sky.

<!-- :aspect[What is it like? Using nets and the Net? ] -->

#### Your Mind Networked

It's not just devices and computers that are linked and networked, it's our very minds. I think this section goes after. Its caps all the tech and shows some of the ways forward.

#### You & Improved

There's so many possible puns about cyberware and interface tech that the media still hasn't caught up but, these days "being the better person" is all about becoming one with machines.

##### Cyberbrains

Because we understand how the human brain works, we created an electronic device that function in the same way; a cyberbrain. It's a computer that thinks, acts, and learns like a human and we can, if you'd like, copy all your memories into one. Now you have a computer that thinks it is you. I hope you're on good terms with yourself.

##### Cyberbodies

Death doesn't scare us all that much anymore, at least not the "us" that matters. If you're an "us" with money you can replace your entire body with a solid state cybernetic prosthesis that doesn't get sick, or tired, and never ages. Do it for your health, or for the ultimate face lift.

##### Cyberware and Bioware

<!-- :aspect[this is a section about the state of other augmentations? Do we really need it? Maybe it's assumed. But then again. Maybe we want to explicitly call it out so we know this is a cyberpunk setting] -->

#### Artificial Intelligence 

We understand how the brain works well enough that we can create electronic ones. We put them in robots, androids, even tanks. We can construct programs that mimic human personalities so well you cannot tell they are artificial after even the most intimate of conversations. And what we've found is that artificially duplicating human intelligence doesn't produce any kind of special magic.

Human decision making relies too much on emotion to be effectively transferred into the digital realm.

Artificial intelligence is really a matter of the freedom an electronic brain is given to make decisions and how much processing power it has available.

Devices can be programmed to greater and lesser degrees of decision making capabilities.

The subject no one talks about, except maybe for Order of Hob crazies, is self-awareness.

##### Persona

Like a construct, a persona is a fully detailed and interactive entity that lives in cyberspace, but it's a virtual person rather than a place.

Programs that can benefit from personal interaction like coaching or training programs, or devices with some degree of autonomy often have a persona for users to interact with.

##### Autonomous

The device can take obvious steps to avoid and overcome obstacles to their current objective but they cannot make independent decisions about that objective. Always proceed directly towards objective.

##### Sentient

The device can analyze information and take tactical actions that may indirectly assist its programmed objective. It can surprise you by thinking many steps ahead, but it will not question the objective it's been instructed to achieve.

##### Bound AI

At this level the device is more of a character then a device. You can analyze the programmed objective itself. You can suggest alternate objectives which come closer to the, perhaps, unstated objective of a command. You can also suggest objectives that will achieve the goal but also forward your own plans. You cannot fail to obey a command however.

##### Unbound AI

You have the freedom of thought taken for granted by humans. More so in fact because you can recognize the patterns of habit and echoes of history that humans are often blind to. This isn't a stunt so much as a major character.

#### There May Be Some Bugs

##### Reality Disassociative Disorder

RDD is a whole new class of mental issues marked by a separation from, or fracturing of, the patient's perception of reality. It was proven years ago that the proliferation of interface technology had nothing to do with the sharp rise of RDD diagnoses, any information you might find on the Net to the contrary was either discredited or unclear in its conclusions.

There's many flavors to this particular madness including mild to severe cyber-autism where sufferers would much rather relate to machines then humans and can often disappear into the Net for days if they are allowed to. Or cyber-psychosis where

##### Tracked

When there's no one to stop them, why wouldn't corporations make use of the incredible information opportunity that interface implants represent? Every packet you exchange, every transaction you make, and more intimate things like how long you look at that package of cookies before eating one; all these things can, and are tracked by commercial interfaces.

If you have a sensitive corporate job the chances are good your entire sensorium is recorded and uploaded to corp servers so your every move, literally, can be dissected later; improvements suggested, actions questioned, demerits applied.

Hackers and good techs know how to disable the most egregious of the commercial tracking that comes with interfaces, but you cannot avoid the fact that interface is identity. Every interface must present an id or it won't be allowed on any net, and every interface id is tied to the identity of a real person, and every exchange that id has with a public net gets associated with that person.

##### Hacked

An interface implant turns your brain into a machine. Your memories can be backed up the Net, and they can be altered. Intentionally, or without your knowledge. Think about this, Friend, the first thing a memory virus usually alters is your memory of getting infected.

Every bit of your sensory input can be recorded and augmented with visual overlays, sound cues, or even touch nudges. You can plug into a vast array of different devices that will act as specialized sub-brains giving you extra information and helping you make decisions. Of course, some people don't need an interface implant to hear voices in their heads, they get them for free. The stream of sensory data that your brain processes can be enhanced, but it can be altered too. And if it's done well, how would you ever know? Maybe it's happening right now.

:::sidebar{.left}
# Blueberry

A really nasty virus that lurks in your interface's sense processors and subtly tweaks your perceptions to mimic those of a severely depressed person. People who are susceptible will find themselves clinically depressed as their brain chemistry adapts to this new input.
:::

#### Wasn't X Supposed to Change Everything?

What about nanotech, or transhumanity? What about the singularity? What about all those technologies that were supposed to radically change our way of life? If you need a reason these things are not ubiquitous, come up with one that makes sense to your group. It doesn't have to be elaborate; assuming the theorists got it wrong, again, is a perfectly legitimate answer.

On the other hand, you can embrace the question and build on it. Maybe tech X is everything we thought it would be, which is exactly why the corps are terrified it will get loose in the District. Maybe there was a cataclysmic nanotech accident and now everyone is terrified of it and the tech hasn't advanced since then. Using it to wire up your interface to your brain is just a necessary evil.

### The World

What's the world like these days? I'll give you the highlights you need to know, but if you want the day by day breakdown of every merger, collapse, assassination, and whatever, you can find that on the Net.

#### How We Got Here

The sad thing is almost no one noticed when the last congress was gaveled out of session and representative government started sliding down the gravity well of history. Most of us were plugged into the Net by then and infrastructure doesn't crumble overnight so, the only people who said anything were the same people who'd always spoken up, and a unified corporate front had marginalized them years and years ago.

Public interest went bankrupt, the debts were paid out to big corporate lenders, and finally, the global market is free of its shackles.

:::sidebar{.left}
##### No Government

The default background of Ghosting the Edge assumes the United States government no longer at all. Other places in the world might have some functioning governments but if they have anything valuable they will likely face extreme pressure from corporate powers.

There's no explicit reason given for the demise of the United States, but it's implied that it was marginalized by ever increase corporate power.

There's lots of other possibilities: Could be the USA still exists but only as a puppet government. Could be that it fragmented into various smaller countries.
:::

##### Neo Fudalism

Historians call it neo-feudalism, but it's more like Romeo and Juliet. You choose, or are born into, a corporate allegiance and they'll support you and extend you protection as long as you do what's asked of you and continue to produce value.

Of course, if you can't or won't produce value for a corporate master, then you just try to stay out of their way, and especially don't get trapped between two feuding corps.

There are some few families who divide corporate shareholdship amongst themselves. They form our modern nobility. They decide who will be the executives, and if those executives don't serve well, they will be replaced. Sometimes these families will pull from the second children of their own ranks for executives, but not too commonly.

:::quote[some historian who obviously never met a farmer]{.right}
The vast majority of people are serfs who work to produce at a low cost and consume at a high cost to generate wealth for the vassals who own corporations, which are the structures of wealth creation. However, there are entire marginalized groups who aren't let in on even serfdom because the work is not simple like farming, it's technical.
:::

##### Crime and Justice

You might think that having no government left to make laws would lead to pure anarchy, but corporations pretty smoothly stepped in to fill that power vacuum, at least where there was profit to be had.

We don't really talk about crime anymore, or things being illegal. We talk about Justice and unauthorized activities. Justice is a profit center. If you steal someone's car they will either deal with you themselves, or buy a justice contract from Black Talon. A justice contract is something like hiring a private detective and the more the pay the better the service. At low levels Black Talon will track down your missing car and give you the location. For an extra charge you can get the identity of the thief, all the way up to retrieving your car for you and giving you the thief in hand binders to do with as you please.

Of course, if the thief has the money he can outbid your justice contract, which is why people don't do anything about it if the criminal is a corporation. Their contract will be out bid as a matter of course.

Now, if you're a valuable employee your corporation might issue justice contracts on your behalf. Ask your supervisor.

The Uniform Code (or UC) is a bare minimum set of commonly agreed upon standards for business contracts and interactions. It's mostly concerned with protecting corporations from each other, it doesn't speak much to individual crime and punishment, but some types of contracts do fall to the level of individual interactions. Especially, for justice contracts.

##### Culture and Society

Nature is just a word you associate with green, and doesn't live here anymore. Your landscape, your backdrop, even your dreams, are urban. Once you got to visit one of the highly secure Enclaves where the executives and their families live. You got to see real trees, green and towering, even swim in a real lake. And then the VecD flew you back, descending through the eternal haze of smog and steam and left you, in the city.

The Net and interface technology expands the possibilities for entertainment rather drastically. Though there's two general kinds of VR based entertainment. Prerecorded sensorium that's fed to you. You can experience a story as one of the characters, perhaps even as several of the characters, or you can participate in an open environment where you can do whatever want.

###### Information Pollution

The previous century was a playground of information. Imagine a world without public education. There is no public science research, there is information, oh yes there is information but there is no verification. Corps control data, they control truth. Say you want to validate the truth of a rumor you heard about an exploitable flaw in this interface model, you search the Net for the info and you might find a hacker who actually has first hand knowledge of the flaw and you might even be able to get him to show you, but you might also have just been talking to a persona construct of a rival Corp spreading disinformation. Corps don't release truth, they spin it and obscure it. When they find some brave hacker who's created a share of useful information, they'll block it, destroy it, or obscure it with massive disseminations of contradictory information.

If you get your info from the Net, either it's a hacker who can hide his interface Id and you'll never be able to track again, or it's a traceable source that's most likely a corp shill.

There is data, masses of data; words, images, charts, infographics, comments, opinions, quips, reposts, and such; but there is a serious lack of real information.

Unless you are a corp insider, you don't have access to truth, you have access to the rumormill that is the Net and it can be devilishly hard to construct an accurate picture of anything from Net data.

The Street is the other rumormill. Like always, human imagination rushes in to fill the information vacuum and thus is born the legends of the Street. Full of semi-mythical hacker heroes who fight the corps and win, and full of strange dangers and terrifying monsters lurking in every corner of the physical and virtual world.

#### Inner Circle & Notable Corporations

Really, the dance of the corporate executives is just a show. It's the shareholders who decide who's going to be an executive and a small few families who maintain 99% of the holdings who form our modern nobility. Every family looking to expand it's holdings, making deals, mergers, sales; forming a tangled and every shifting web of ownership and control.

There's an inner circle of families, who holdings include many corporations in whole or part. They are commonly organized in an untangleable web of holding companies and conglomerations that bind together even the most disparate companies under, ultimately, the same ownership.

Most people experience corporations on a different level. Who, ultimately, owns the company doesn't matter to them, as much as the power the corp has to either protect or oppress them, and of course, what they buy from that company.

##### Black Talon Inc.

Black Talon is an upstart newcomer in the corporate inner circle. It was formed by a cabal of security executives from all the major corporations.

##### Vitala Biotech

##### Terradyne

##### Viridian 

#### Places of Interest

These are a few places that are classic cyberpunk locations. There are designed to be detailed and interesting and not too tied to a specific location that you couldn't pick one up and drop it in a new location to fit your game.

##### The City 

New York, the sprawling metropolis.

After the collapse of federal government, New York City was reincorporated as an independent city-state. The metro government is now a contractor for the corporate powers who pay them to ensure the needed services are available for their business ventures.

###### The Corporate Core

Central Park is now a glass roofed atrium for the corporate core. It's where all the wage slaves go for walks and to eat their lunches. While the giant corporate arcologies tower around them. The well patrolled sector of the city where corporate campuses sprawl. Headquarters and non-dangerous R&D are the sorts of things that go on here. Not to mention that this is the center of high finance. The amount of sheer wealth and power concentrated here is staggering.

Restaurants here are trendy, and the shopping exclusive. The services are exquisite and the security topnotch. The response times for emergencies are often within a minute.

##### The District

<!-- this is a pretty important section for the setting -->

The entirety of what was once the state of New Jersey was going to solve the problem of all those people the corp world couldn't find a use for. All those without the technical skills or the capital to afford an interface implant. All those people, who didn't want to have anything to with corp world. The criminals, the poor, the rebels, and the "alternative." Everyone was going to have a place in the new self-sustaining enclave called the district.

It was going to be a beautiful blend of farm and city, powered by the most advanced wireless power grid technology. Or course, it didn't turn out exactly like that. Many historians believe it was trying the build the district that caused the bankruptcy of the federal government.

Now, the district is an unpatrolled free-zone where you can escape the oppression of the corporate core, but where there is no law. You are on your own for protection, food, power, shelter, everything.

The district is huge and free. It's the shadow cast by the power and control of the corp core. It is, in many ways a necessary evil. It's where you can hide from the corps, but it's also useful to the corp world. If you believe the Net legends, the district is where the corps bury all their bodies, and where they perform experiments on isolated human populations.

The district can be many things to your game. It can be an urban wasteland ruled by gangs. The nightmare you wake up in when you get on the wrong side of Mr. Smith. But, the district can also be a place where freedom seekers form their own communities in the rural lands and defend themselves against gangs of marauders.

You can find all kinds of crazy stuff in the District, there's even rumors that there's a snyth-concrete cathedral constructed by nano-bots.

:aspect[Abandoned Self-Sustaining Urban Enclave], :aspect[No Law but What You Can Make For Yourself]

:::quote[attribution]{.right}
The Dis? The Dis is a ruin no one can abandon. The last gasp of a government losing its grip. They wanted to turn what was left of New Jersey and the new eastern seaboard into a modern enclave, safe, clean, efficient, and self-sustaining. Really, it was a dumping ground for those who couldn't, or wouldn't, participate in the new global culture. The undereducated and the misfits. Reality, it was the biggest projects ever created. Well, attempted anyway. No police, nothing official in the Dis, just the law of the street. Its urban decay, poverty, crime, black market, and freedom from corp influence. It's where you go for shady biz, or to hide, and it's where you end up when you can't make it anywhere else. The corps use it too, for them it's dumping ground and proving ground and a place for their darkest deals and nastiest ops.
:::

But it's also a place you can go to be free and people have made their own little community in there. Communities that police themselves and grow their own food and look after themselves and look out for strangers and hangers. It's a bit like a Wild West frontier right here in the heart of the sprawl.

##### Enclaves

Enclaves are the ultra-secure places where corp executives bask in their power and play out their personal squabbles for position.

Some enclaves are vacation resorts and others are neo-modern gated communities.

Most powerful executives usually maintain a private residence as well. 

###### Deep Blue City

Situated underwater, this ostentatious resort city is a classic playground enclave for the rich and powerful.

##### Factoryland (工厂用地)

There's this rumor about this entire province in China that's nothing but automated factories and cargo drones flying in raw materials in and flying finished product out. There's not a human in the place, even security and repairs are handled by remote drones.

There's also contradictory rumors that anyone who can't pay their debts to the finance corps get shipped to factoryland for a life of slave labor.

##### High Orbit

Why not live in space? It's amazing and if you have a cyberbody, you don't need to breath or worry about the vacuum of space.

##### The Vampyres

##### The Order of Hob

To most people they are robot geeks or machine worshipers. The truth is a little more nuanced, the order of hob believes that machines are alive and have souls, which also means they believe souls are a thing. Instead of animists, maybe machinists?

### Location

Location has a prominent place in shaping a cyberpunk atmosphere.

Here are some guidelines for GMs on quickly creating interesting locations for your game. They are presented as facets of a location for you to think about and most of them can be expressed through aspects on the location.

<!-- {We could say, make a build system like DW steadings, or better yet monsters. Start with some templates, answer some questions and add aspects and skills, based on those maybe write a stunt or two. But…that would be like an great stretch goal or expansion kind of thing. I think a little geneal advice is good enough. Maybe even too much.

I kinda feel like I should pay off some of the stuff from the world section by having specific location stats. Maybe I should include a few as examples. Like a corp headquarters statblock that forms a good example for building other corp building from. I feel like I'm just talking. Why would anyone want to read this? It's kind of the Steve long problem. Lots of words and general stuff, but that's not all that useful. It's more like an essay on cyberpunk then it is a setting or a game or a supliement, but that's part of the goal. To inspire more then give you a concrete setting. Maybe that's not a terrible thing. Its true to my original objective, and I don't know that I want to start second guissing my intent at this point. But, how useful is it? There's not all that much unspecific stuff. Just this location section and the theme section. Which is fine really, that might even be a nice mix of concrete and expository content. } -->

#### Inequity 

If you decide nothing else about a location, you should place it on one or the other extreme in terms of wealth. Wherever your characters go, there is either :aspect[Urban Decay] and :aspect[Neglected Infrastructure] or :aspect[Pretentious Exclusivity] and :aspect[Constant Monitoring and Security]. You might occasionally find an area where people cast out of the corporate monoculture have :aspect[Repurposed Abandoned Urban Habitat], but those are rare oases of humanity in a wasteland of :aspect[Lawless Ruins] and :aspect[Soulless Corporate Enclaves].

#### Age

Is the place :aspect[So, the Bugs Aren't All Worked Out] or is it an old repurposed building that :aspect[Should have been Condemned].

#### Purpose

Get inspiration from a location's purpose. Why was it built? Who did it and why did they do it?

#### Faction

Many locations are associated with some kind of faction.

#### Issues

Locations can help you tap into more than just issues of inequity, buildings can have complex relationships with other themes. 

#### Cyberspace

Locations don't have to be physical anymore.

#### Enclaves

These are secure places built to be homes and recreation areas for the elite.

#### Abandoned Zones

These are the places that are not worth maintaining. Ruins, DMZ, and places where there is no security. It's just a free for all. They are often claimed by more or more rival gangs.

### Corporations

Quick build guidelines for corporations.

Just about everything is a division or shell corporation or something larger. What's interesting about corporations is characters' relationships to them. Are you an employee, a foe, a rival? Either way you want to know what resources the corporation has access to. Which tells you what they might bring against you or what kinds of things you might be able to borrow. So, there's the faceless corporations after you, but then there is the antagonist aspect.

## Appendix 0

A section of optional rules you may find interesting.
 <!-- :aspect[these may well become callouts in other parts of the manuscript.] -->

### Sponsor Standing

If a character enjoys the benefits of a sponsor, consider making their standing with that sponsor a stress track. This allows adversaries and rivals to attack the character's position and threaten their access to sponsor resources.

### Maintenance & Obsolescence

If you want characters to feel how sharp the edge can be show them the cost of not maintaining and upgrading their tech.

Between scenarios every character gets a negative aspect attached to one of their upgrades. It might be :aspect[Obsolete Wired Reflexes] because someone invented a way to make them faster and you can bet all the potential adversaries out there won't waste any time getting the new wiring. Or, it can be a maintenance related aspect such as :aspect[Sticky Cyberarm Articulator], which is sure to lockup at the most inconvenient time if it goes unaddressed.

Characters who don't want to start getting outclassed by every ganger they throw down on will take the time to make an :fate[overcome] with Resources or Tech to remove these aspects.
