Jet engines scream throught the smog overhead and tonight's greasy rain on your mirrorshades smears the scavenged neon of High Street Market. Every face in the twisting makeshift stalls gets sniffed from your visual cortex by the program your client provided and pumped back into your field of vision with a color-coded match percentage. 58%...12%...70%...68%...95% — "Hey there, Friend."

Cold metal drops, soft as a spider, on the back of your neck and a garishly graphiced warning floats across the bottom of your vision. This smartass hacked their 'safety's off' to broadcast a custom weapons-free alert. 

Welcome to the Edge

# Ghosting the Edge

This chapter is for everyone. It's ground level concepts and questions to help you make this dystopian future your own.

## Fate & Cyberpunk

A Fate game is about competent, proactive, and dramatic characters. A cyberpunk game is about fighting to survive and thrive in a future where the worst of what our world has to offer is exaggerated to extremes. It's a dangerous world where even characters with powerful backing find themselves dancing daily on the razor's edge of ruin or success. You'll play people who fight the system trying to build a life of their own choosing, however short, in the cracks and shadows of oppressive corporate domination.

### Essential Cyberpunk

<!-- Basic concepts and tropes of cyberpunk. Such as cyberware, and what is the Net. Especially what the Net is -->

### Cranking the Engine

When you are building your cyberpunk game talk about what kinds of activities crank your gaming engine. Matrix style high action? Terminating rogue cyborgs and AI devices? Dancing in the shadows cast by the mega corps doing dirty jobs while playing the corps against either other. Fighting from inside the corrupt system to do the right thing while not getting ID'ed as a liability.

Whatever kind of interests brings you to cyberpunk, use that to create a story engine, some situation rich enough to continually suggest stories that will drive your game forward in a commonly agreed upon direction.

As you read through the rest of this chapter, talk about how the concepts might inform the story engine of your game. You'll know you have good game issues and character aspects when they become a story engine for your game.

### Orientation

If there's a dark center to a cyberpunk game its corporations and the oppressive domination they represent. Corporations are not simply powerful, they are the very structure of power in the same way hereditary nobility was the structure of power in the past. Everyone has a relationship to corporations and orientation is simply asking a character "what is your relationship to corporations?"

I'll describe three possible orientations: Sponsored, Revolutionary, or On the Edge. There's no need to pick just one; some people have very complicated relationships to power.

#### Using Orientation

Orientation significantly shapes a game. You can use it to establish conflicts and tension. For example, individual characters have an orientation, but the player characters as a group might have a different one, however temporarily, that not all the PCs are comfortable with. Groups, factions, or even neighborhoods a character is associated with might also have a clashing orientation, or change their orientation during the game.

#### Sponsored

Sponsored means you are supported by someone of great power and influence. The classic example is being employed by a major corporation, but you might also be the personal retainer of a powerful individual or under the protection of a free AI.

Being sponsored gives you access to gear, intel, and support both financial and political, but at a price. Never forget you are just another tool and everything depends on being of value to your sponsor. All kinds of things will threaten your position. Office rivalries can turn every day into a competition. You will have to carry the weight of all the dirty tasks you do.

Sponsorship is not a guarantee and it's especially not guaranteed to last forever. Maybe you're rival will final sabotage your position, maybe you'll learn something that makes you a threat to your sponsor, or maybe they'll just get tired of seeing your face.

If your character has a sponsor, ask yourself: "How far will your character go to secure their position?" "How high will they rise, and how long can they hold on?" "What will they do if they lose their sweet deal?"

#### Revolutionary

Instead of being a corporate tool you actively fights the system. You might be a nomad, outcast, criminal, anarchist, or even full-fledged revolutionary who's declared war on your corporate overlords.

You face more than just the confines of the modern surveillance culture, but also the masses of corporate employees more concerned with their own position then the truth. You'll likely be a labeled a terrorist, perhaps with good reason, and you'll be a constant target; hounded from safehouse to safehouse. At least you have their attention.

"How far will you go to bring the system down? What will you give up, and who will you abandon?" "What will you do when they catch up to you?"

#### On the Edge

Maybe you're not so much into responsibility or ideology, maybe you just want to do your own thing. On the Edge describes an ambivalent orientation towards the corporate power structure. Not a part of system and not actively against it. This is a common stance for freelancers selling their skills to the highest bidder. You might revel in the relative freedom but you'll find themselves being used as a pawn in the power struggles of others; Always chasing the next deal, hopefully one step ahead of disaster. If you find this orientation attractive you should ask yourself, "How long can you survive on the edge?"

### Theme

To make a theme ask yourself a grand question like "is there a soul?" Your game is the answer to that question. The point of a theme is to give your game something to be about that's not just oddly violent odd jobs. It gives you a goal to align play and a touchstone to return to if your game wanders off into wilds.

You can open-endedly explore a thematic question, but also consider definitely answering the question and using your game to explore how that answer affects everything. For example: Yes, there is a measurable, but unidentifiable factor in the brain that some people choose to label a soul. Do you care? What if you found out you're missing that particular factor? Does that factor survive if your memories are copied to cybernetic brain?

Characters don't have to interact directly with a theme, but it is more interesting if they have a stake in it.

Cyberpunk is rich in potential themes, especially ones that intersect with technology; here's three places to start.

#### Technology and Humanity

We are steeped in technology and a deep understanding of the mind. We this technology lets us share our thoughts and construct artificial intelligences. Given that, what does it mean to be a human? Is there anything special about us? When every device we smart enough to make decisions for us; what's the point of us?

Is there a soul? A ghost? If you copy all your memories into a device is that device you? Will it have a consciousness? Will it be your consciousness?

#### Technology and Alienation 

We can create virtual reality indistinguishable from true reality, and make far more attractive to our brains. We pipe these virtual worlds directly into our brains so, does true reality matter anymore? Do we need relationships with real humans or are AIs enough? The entire concept of public and citizenship have disappeared, do we miss it?

Can an AI be programmed with empathy? And if it can, can it fall in love with a human? And if it does can a human truly return that love? How can it be a true relationship when you can turn off your partner whenever you want? What do you do when the AI that you have fallen in love with leaves you for someone more interesting?

#### Technology and Society

When just about everyone who matters has what amounts to a tracking device and marketing research system implanted in there head, does privacy exist anymore? If not, do you miss it? Has technology overwhelmed personal freedom? What devious things do corporations do with this window directly into the brains of millions of people and is there anyone or anything to stop them?

Advancements in AI mean we are freed from manual labor and even most service jobs, but what about all the people who used to do those things? What happened to them?

Wealth inequality doesn't even begin to describe the state of the world anymore. The very wealthy live as isolated and protected as a hidden Shaolin Monastery. Then there's the lucky few clinging to the life line of their corp job. And finally, there's the whole masses of people who are unemployable and obsolete, or who don't want to participate in the system. Where do they fit in and how do they survive?

Is government still relevant? Does it still even exist or do people swear their allegiance to a corporation? If given the technology, will people self-organize into tribes? If they do will corporations feel threatened and take counter measures? If you trade your freedom to the corporations for security is what you get worth it?

If there is no government or public education, or public science, then how can we know what's going on? Media is a corporate business and the Net is full of data, but lacking in real information.
